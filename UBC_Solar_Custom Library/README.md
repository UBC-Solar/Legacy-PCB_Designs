Add this directory to your eagle library directory:
  1. choose "options" tab on eagle
  2. "Directory"
  3. Add the destination of the library folder in your computer to the "Libraries" list
  4. use semicolon ; to separate directories from each other when you have more than 1(in this case your custom library and main eagle    library)
